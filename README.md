# ☑️ ServiGo

### Home Services & EV Charging Booking Platform

A full-featured web application that connects customers with verified local service professionals — electricians, plumbers, and Smart TV experts — alongside a live network of EV charging stations with slot booking. Built on **Django 5.2** with role-based dashboards for customers, staff, and administrators.

## 📖 Project Overview

ServiGo simplifies the way people manage home maintenance and electric vehicle charging — through a single, user-friendly platform.

Customers can quickly book professional services such as electrical repairs, plumbing, and Smart TV maintenance, or reserve a slot at a nearby EV charging station. Staff and administrators get powerful tools to manage bookings, services, customers, and operational workflows — all from dedicated role-based dashboards.

Built with Django and Bootstrap 5, ServiGo focuses on usability, security, and maintainability while demonstrating a practical implementation of authentication, CRUD operations, email notifications, role-based access control, and responsive web design.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12, Git.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd ServiGo

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment variables
Copy-Item .env.example .env   # Windows PowerShell
# cp .env.example .env        # macOS / Linux

# 5. Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# 6. Seed demo data (categories, services, EV stations, demo users)
python manage.py seed_demo

# 7. Run the development server
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8004
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8004> in your browser.

On Windows you can use the shortcut launcher instead:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_dev.ps1          # starts on 127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 👥 Demo Accounts

`seed_demo` creates the following accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
| ---- | ----- | -------- |
| **Admin** | `admin@servigo.com` | `admin12345` |
| **Staff** | `staff@servigo.com` | `staff12345` |
| **Customer** | `customer@servigo.com` | `customer12345` |

### 🛡️ Create an Admin Account Manually

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (or rely on sensible defaults):

| Variable | Description | Default |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Django secret key — set a strong value in production | generated dev key |
| `DEBUG` | Debug mode (`True`/`False`) | `True` |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated allowed hosts | `localhost,127.0.0.1,testserver` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Production database URL (e.g. PostgreSQL) | SQLite (dev) |
| `EMAIL_HOST` / `EMAIL_PORT` / etc. | SMTP settings for booking confirmation emails | console email (dev) |

---

## 🔒 Security

- **Custom `User` model** with email as the unique identifier — username login still supported via an email-or-username backend.
- **Role-restricted public registration** — only `customer` and `staff` can sign up through the public form; `admin` is created only via `seed_demo` or the Django admin, preventing self-service privilege escalation.
- **Role-based access control** — staff/admin views are gated by dedicated mixins; dashboards and booking data are filtered per user.
- **Open-redirect protection** — the login `next` parameter is validated with `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme`.
- **Session-based auth** with Django's built-in password hashing.

## Recent Enhancements

The project now includes:

- EV charging slot conflict prevention based on overlapping reservations and station port capacity.
- Automatic current EV port availability synchronization after booking, cancellation, and staff status changes.
- Automatic customer profile statistics synchronization for service booking count and completed-service spend.
- Automatic booking lifecycle timestamps for confirmed, started/in-progress, completed, and cancelled states.
- Customer reviews and 1–5 star ratings for completed home-service bookings and completed EV charging bookings.
- Review management in Django Admin and review summaries on service and EV station detail pages.
- Demo review data through `python manage.py seed_demo`.

## Railway-ready deployment

The project now supports both local SQLite and Railway PostgreSQL without changing the application code:

- If `DATABASE_URL` is empty, local development uses `db.sqlite3`.
- If `DATABASE_URL` is present, Django uses PostgreSQL.
- WhiteNoise serves collected static files in production.
- `Procfile` runs migrations and Gunicorn for Railway.
- `DEPLOY_RAILWAY.md` contains the deployment checklist.

For production, set a new `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG=False`, the Railway public domain, and connect a Railway PostgreSQL service through `DATABASE_URL`.
